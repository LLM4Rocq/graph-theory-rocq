# graph-theory-rocq

![corpus-status](https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/graph-theory-rocq/actions/workflows/corpus-status.yml/badge.svg)
**OpenProblemGarden corpus: statement-complete** — 227/227 attempted · **208 done** (axiom-free
`Definition <name>_statement : Prop`, `Print Assumptions` clean) · **12 partial** · **7 blocked**.
Release: **`opg-v1.0.1-227-attempted`** (release-time counts 212/8/7; 4 crossing-number rows were
since downgraded to partial — `meta/CORPUS_STATUS.md` is the canonical living report). v1
completion report: [`meta/OPG_FULL_FORMALIZATION_PLAN.md`](meta/OPG_FULL_FORMALIZATION_PLAN.md).

**v2 corpus (growing)** — every conjecture source of the upstream `graph-conjectures` repo:
**1,745 rows tracked** (762 arXiv + 277 erdősproblems + 138 attack-engine derived + 568
studies-slice) · ~1,075 statement-owing after triage, the rest parked/alias/edge-anchor with
documented dispositions · 0 statements yet (X0 infrastructure milestone complete). Plan:
[`meta/V2_FULL_CORPUS_PLAN.md`](meta/V2_FULL_CORPUS_PLAN.md); live counts in
[`meta/CORPUS_STATUS.md`](meta/CORPUS_STATUS.md).

A monorepo of Rocq/MathComp **graph-theory** libraries — the math-comp model (one repo,
many independently-installable opam packages). Each `<area>-theory/` subdir states the open
conjectures of one area of graph theory (and gains their proofs over time).

Built on [`coq-graph-theory`](https://github.com/rocq-community/graph-theory) (undirected) and
MathComp. The roadmap + the validated 227-problem manifest live in **`meta/`**. Verify the
statement-complete claim with `make audit` (toolchain-free) or the full `make gate` (Coq builds).

Σ = 142 core + 85 deferred = 227.

## Layout
- `base/` — `coq-graph-theory-base`: the single owner of cross-area primitives (interop façade,
  homomorphism, products, list-χ, line/total-graph, Δ).
- `<area>-theory/` — the area packages (each: foundations/core/invariants/constructions/conjectures/applications).
- `meta/` — the v1 completion report + roadmap (`OPG_FULL_FORMALIZATION_PLAN.md`), the validated 227-row
  manifest + leg-state overlay, the federated dependency graph (`dependency_graph.json`), the status report
  (`CORPUS_STATUS.md`), and the gates (`check_milestone.py`, `report_corpus_status.py`, `build_edge_graph.py`).
- `atlas/`, `blueprint/` — *scaffolds* reserved for later extraction of the cross-area edge atlas and the
  shared dev tooling; both currently live in `meta/` (see the stubs' `Status: scaffold`).

`digraph-theory/` was absorbed from the standalone repo via a subtree merge (history preserved).
See `meta/OPG_FULL_FORMALIZATION_PLAN.md` §A / §A.1.
