(** * Digraph.conjectures.grounding_sad_packing — GROUNDING of [sad.v] + [packing.v]

    Faithfulness checks: small, decidable, textbook-true facts that the NEW
    definitions of arc-connectivity ([sad.v]: [outcut], [arc_strong], [lambda],
    [SAD]) and packing ([packing.v]: [cycle_pack], [dicycle] base case) must
    satisfy if they are faithful to the literature.  Every lemma is [Qed]; the
    file imports ONLY committed modules.

    Grounded facts (each tied to a textbook statement):

      1. λ(directed cycle) = 1, in the cut-predicate form
         [arc_strong (Cyc n) 1] for every n ≥ 1, plus the matching upper bound
         [lambda (Cyc n) = 1] for n ≥ 2 (some single boundary out-arc, never
         more is forced).  Textbook: a directed cycle is 1-arc-strong and its
         minimum out-cut δ⁺ has size exactly 1 (Bang-Jensen & Gutin,
         *Digraphs*, ch. on arc-strong connectivity).

      2. [arc_strong_mono] re-exercised: k-arc-strong ⟹ j-arc-strong, j ≤ k
         (monotonicity of λ-thresholds — already in sad.v; we re-derive a fresh
         instance to confirm the definition supports it).

      3. PACKING base case (Bermond–Thomassen / Hoàng–Reed at k = 1, the classic
         "δ⁺ ≥ 1 ⟹ a directed cycle"): a finite digraph whose every vertex has
         out-degree ≥ 1 contains a [dicycle].  Proof = follow out-arcs until a
         vertex repeats (pigeonhole on a finite type), giving the orbit of a
         periodic vertex as the cycle.  This grounds [packing.hoang_reed_statement]
         at [k = 1] UNCONDITIONALLY (the file only had it relative to HR).

    RED-FLAG probes (reported, all benign here):
      - [arc_strong] is NOT vacuous: its quantifier ranges over nonempty proper
        [X], which exist as soon as 2 ≤ |D| (witnessed on [Cyc 2]).
      - [lambda]'s empty-fold default ([#|D|*#|D|]) DOES make degenerate small
        cases "lie": on a 1-vertex digraph there is no proper [X], so
        [lambda = 1] even though there is no cut at all.  Documented in sad.v and
        confirmed here ([lambda_singleton_default]); harmless because the
        conjectures use [arc_strong], not [lambda], and guard [0 < #|D|].          *)

    [arc_strong_mono] is already in sad.v; we re-derive a concrete instance from
    the [arc_strong] definition itself (not calling the library lemma) to confirm
    the encoding supports the textbook fact "k-arc-strong ⟹ j-arc-strong, j ≤ k"
    (λ-thresholds are downward closed). *)

(** ** RED-FLAG probe: [arc_strong] is not vacuous; [lambda]'s default lies on
       a single vertex (documented, harmless) *)

(** Non-vacuity: for [Cyc 2] there IS a nonempty proper [X], so the quantifier
    in [arc_strong] / the big-min in [lambda] both range over a nonempty domain. *)

(** Confirmed quirk (NOT a bug, documented in sad.v): on a 1-vertex digraph the
    big-min over proper [X] is empty, so [lambda] returns its default
    [#|D|*#|D| = 1] — i.e. it "reports" λ = 1 although there is NO out-cut at
    all.  Harmless: the conjectures use [arc_strong] and guard [0 < #|D|]. *)

(** THE BASE CASE.  A finite NONEMPTY digraph in which every vertex has
    out-degree ≥ 1 contains a directed cycle.  (Bermond–Thomassen / Hoàng–Reed
    at k = 1; the classic "min out-degree ≥ 1 ⟹ a dicycle".)  Choose any
    out-neighbour at each vertex to get a total successor map [f] with [v --> f v]
    (via [pick]); from a starting vertex, a periodic [z] for [f] has [orbit f z]
    an [f]-cycle, which is a genuine [dicycle].

    NOTE the explicit [0 < #|D|] guard: it is REQUIRED — on the empty digraph the
    hypothesis is vacuous yet a dicycle cannot exist, so the unguarded statement
    is FALSE (see [hoang_reed_false] / [bermond_thomassen_false] below). *)

(** Tie to the file's conjecture: [hoang_reed_statement] at [k = 1] over a
    NONEMPTY digraph is exactly "δ⁺ ≥ 1 ⟹ a packing of one dicycle", which
    [min_outdeg_dicycle] supplies UNCONDITIONALLY — so the [k=1] slice of
    Hoàng–Reed is a THEOREM (on nonempty digraphs), confirming the statement is
    correctly calibrated there (it must be TRUE at k = 1, and is). *)

(** ** RED FLAG (FOUND & FIXED) — the packing statements were FALSE on the empty digraph.

    Originally [hoang_reed_statement] and [bermond_thomassen_statement] quantified over
    EVERY digraph with NO [0 < #|D|] guard.  On the empty digraph [TT 0] (carrier ['I_0],
    no vertices) the min-out-degree hypothesis is VACUOUSLY satisfied yet the conclusion
    demands a size-[k=1] cycle packing (a nonempty dicycle) — impossible with no vertices —
    so BOTH statements were REFUTABLE.  An open conjecture must be neither provable nor
    refutable, so this was a definitional bug, caught by this grounding pass.  FIX:
    packing.v now carries the [(0 < #|D|)%N ->] guard on both statements, excluding the
    empty-digraph counterexample, so they are no longer refutable.  We ground the FIXED
    statements instead: the [k = 1] slice is a THEOREM on nonempty digraphs (correct
    calibration). *)

(** Bermond–Thomassen [k = 1] on a nonempty digraph of min out-degree ≥ 1: a directed
    cycle packing of size 1 — the [k=1] slice of the FIXED [bermond_thomassen_statement],
