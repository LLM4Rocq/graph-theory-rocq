(** * ClassicalLemmas.caratheodory.caratheodory — Carathéodory's theorem over ℚ

    A convex combination of points of ℚ^d can be rewritten as a convex
    combination of at most [d+1] of them.  The points are given as functions
    ['I_d -> rat] (coordinates), which is how the statistics of a matching are
    presented downstream; matrices appear only inside the proof, to produce an
    affine dependency once more than [d+1] weights are positive. *)

    HOW THIS FILE WAS OBTAINED.  It was written with Claude Code (Anthropic),
    model Claude Opus 5, on 15-16 September 2026, as one piece of the
    formalization of Conjecture 1.15 of arXiv:1611.03196 (the X15 milestone of
    packing-theory).  Rocq was driven interactively.  The rocq-mcp-evolve MCP
    server of the LLM4Rocq project,
    https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/rocq-mcp-evolve (Apache-2.0; the opam package
    still carries its former slug LLM4Rocq/rocq-tools), is used throughout this
    repository for that purpose and is gratefully acknowledged; for this file
    its cached project configuration predated the move of classical-lemmas into
    subdirectories, so goals were read instead from a small [rocq repl] harness
    and files recompiled with [rocq c].  Every error that recurred, together
    with the tactic that fixed it, is recorded in tactics-playbook.md at the
    root of the repository.  Nothing is admitted: [Print Assumptions] on the
    results of this file answers "Closed under the global context".

    ESTIMATED TOKEN COST FOR THIS FILE.  Claude Opus 5, 156k tokens, of which
    72k output.  Method: as in necklace/necklace.v — for every assistant
    message of the Claude Code session of 15-16 September 2026, input +
    cache-creation + output tokens (the tokens processed anew, excluding the
    cached conversation that is re-read at each turn), charged to the file the
    message's tool calls were acting on.  The whole X15 phase of that session
    totals 1.86M such tokens, 0.82M of them output, plus one context rebuild
    charged to no file.

             hull of a set in dimension d is a convex combination of at most
             d+1 of its points.  Proved here by the standard argument: more
             than d+1 positive weights give an affine dependency, which is
             followed until one weight vanishes.
