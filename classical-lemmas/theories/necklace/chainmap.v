(** * ClassicalLemmas.chainmap — the chain map induced by a simplotopal map

    Meunier (2014), Theorem 2.4, for a target [L = (Δ_{p-1})^t].

    The source is an abstract graded chain complex ([cellS], [dimS], [bdS1])
    together with a predicate [okS] singling out the subcomplex on which the
    map is defined (in the application: the faces of [K]), and a map [msp]
    sending a cell to the smallest simplotope of [L] containing its image.
    The simplotopal hypothesis is [msp_dim : Ldim (msp c) <= dimS c].

    We build [mu1 c = α_c ⋅ (msp c)] by induction on [dimS c], exactly as in
    Meunier's proof: the boundary [∂c] is mapped into the facets of [msp c],
    [∂(μ_# ∂c) = 0], so all the facet coefficients agree by [Lfacet_ker2]
    (dimension ≥ 2) or by an augmentation argument ([Lfacet_ker1], dimension 1),
    and [α_c] is their common value.

    Deliverables: [mu_bd] (μ_# is a chain map) and [mu_dim] (if [μ_#σ ≠ 0] then
    [μ] maps [σ] onto a simplotope of the same dimension). *)

    HOW THIS FILE WAS OBTAINED.  It was written with Claude Code (Anthropic),
    driving Rocq interactively through the rocq-mcp-evolve MCP server ("build"
    to list the open goals of a file, "open"/"step"/"try"/"check" to drive a
    single proof), so that a failing tactic was diagnosed on the spot instead
    of by recompiling.  rocq-mcp-evolve is developed by the LLM4Rocq project,
    https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/rocq-mcp-evolve (Apache-2.0; the opam package
    still carries its former slug LLM4Rocq/rocq-tools); it is gratefully
    acknowledged here.  Every error that recurred, together with the tactic
    that fixed it, is recorded in tactics-playbook.md at the root of the
    repository.  No result is admitted: "Print Assumptions" on the results of
    this file answers "Closed under the global context".

    MODELS AND ESTIMATED TOKEN COST FOR THIS FILE.

        Claude Opus 5       123k tokens   (09-15 09:01 -> 09-15 14:18 UTC)
        TOTAL               123k tokens   of which 41k were output

      Method: the figures are estimated from the logs of the Claude Code
      session of 14-15 September 2026.  For every assistant message they count
      input + cache-creation + output tokens, i.e. the tokens processed anew,
      excluding the cached conversation that is re-read at each turn (772M
      over the project); a message is charged to the file its tool calls were
      acting on.  Three whole-session context rebuilds (compaction or resume),
      1.61M tokens in all, are charged to no file.  Project totals: 4.10M
      tokens of per-file work, 1.61M of context rebuilds, 5.70M overall.

    WHAT CORRESPONDS TO WHAT.

      [M14, Theorem 2.4], the chain map induced by a simplotopal map, stated
      over an abstract graded source complex so that it can be applied to the
      cubical complex of cubical.v.

      - [M14, Theorem 2.4], "given a simplotopal map lambda : V(S) -> V(T),
        there exists a unique chain map lambda_# ..."
                                    -> mu1, mu, mu_bd
      - [M14], proof of Theorem 2.4: the recursion on the dimension, and the
        common value alpha_sigma supplied by [M14, Lemma 2.1]
                                    -> alphaOf, muP, mu1_shape
      - [M14], end of the proof of Theorem 3.3, "there is an oriented
        t(p-1)-simplotope sigma of K whose image by mu_# is nonzero", i.e. a
        cell whose image has full dimension
                                    -> mu_dim
      - [M14, Sect. 3.3], the induced chain map is equivariant
                                    -> mu_nu1, mu_equiv *)

Lemma mu_equiv (x : chainS) : (forall c, x c != 0 -> okS c) ->
  mu (lin (fun c => cc (nuS c)) x) = Lnu p_gt0 (mu x).
Proof.
move=> hx; rewrite /mu lin_comp.
have -> : lin (fun c => lin mu1 (cc (nuS c))) x
        = lin (fun c => lin (Lnu1 p_gt0) (mu1 c)) x.
  by apply: lin_eq_supp => c hc; rewrite lin_cc (mu_nu1 (hx c hc)) /Lnu.
by rewrite /Lnu lin_comp.
Qed.
