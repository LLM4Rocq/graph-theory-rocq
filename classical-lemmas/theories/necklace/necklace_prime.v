(** * ClassicalLemmas.necklace_prime — Alon's Splitting Necklace Theorem for a
      prime number of thieves, derived from the ℤ_p-simplotopal Tucker lemma.

    Reference: F. Meunier, "Simplotopal maps and necklace splitting", Discrete
    Math. 323 (2014) 14–26, §3.2 and §3.3 (Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4).

    The necklace has [n] beads, bead [b : 'I_n] occupying the interval
    [[b, b+1)] and having type [c b : 'I_t]; there are [p] thieves.

    §3.2's encoding: a vertex [v : 'I_N -> cut] of [K] is a list of [N]
    cut positions with a thief attached to each ([v j = Some (k, r)] is the
    cut at position [k+1] together with the thief [r]; [v j = None] is the
    cut at position 0).  The resulting splitting assigns bead [b] to the
    thief carried by the FIRST coordinate whose cut lies strictly to the
    right of [b] — this is exactly [covers (v j) b], and the resulting
    assignment is [own v b] below.  [lam v i] is Meunier's [i]-winner: the
    thief owning the largest number of beads of type [i], ties broken by the
    rightmost such bead. *)

    HOW THIS FILE WAS OBTAINED.  It was written with Claude Code (Anthropic),
    driving Rocq interactively through the rocq-mcp-evolve MCP server ("build"
    to list the open goals of a file, "open"/"step"/"try"/"check" to drive a
    single proof), so that a failing tactic was diagnosed on the spot instead
    of by recompiling.  rocq-mcp-evolve is developed by the LLM4Rocq project,
    https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/rocq-mcp-evolve (Apache-2.0; the opam package
    still carries its former slug LLM4Rocq/rocq-tools); it is gratefully
    acknowledged here.  Every error that recurred, together with the tactic
    that fixed it, is recorded in tactics-playbook.md at the root of the
    repository.  No result is admitted: "Print Assumptions" on the results of
    this file answers "Closed under the global context".

      input + cache-creation + output tokens, i.e. the tokens processed anew,
      excluding the cached conversation that is re-read at each turn (772M
      over the project); a message is charged to the file its tool calls were
      acting on.  Three whole-session context rebuilds (compaction or resume),
      1.61M tokens in all, are charged to no file.  Project totals: 4.10M

    WHAT CORRESPONDS TO WHAT.

      [M14, Sect. 3.2 to 3.4]: the "winner" map lambda, the proof that it is an
      equivariant simplotopal map ([M14, Lemma 3.2]), and the extraction of a
      fair splitting from the face produced by [M14, Theorem 3.3]
      ([M14, Lemma 3.4]).  This yields Alon's theorem for a PRIME number of
      thieves.

      - [M14, Sect. 3.2], "denote by x the left endpoint of that subnecklace
        and by y its right endpoint ... take v_j = (k,r) with the smallest j
        such that k >= y; the thief r is the one who gets the l-th
        subnecklace", read one bead at a time (the condition "k >= y" for the
        subnecklace containing bead b is exactly "covers (v j) b")

                                       own (the thief who gets a bead)
      - [M14, Sect. 3.2], "since there is a j such that v_j = (n,r), one of
        these cuts is at position n and is therefore not a real cut; we have
        thus indeed at most t(p-1) cuts"

      - [M14, Sect. 3.2], "define lambda_i(v) as the thief who gets the largest

        The lexicographic order (count, then rightmost bead) is packed into the
        single integer sc = cnt * n.+1 + rk, which is what makes the maximiser
        unique (sc_inj) -- and uniqueness, not just the existence of an argmax,
        is what equivariance needs.

      ONE POINT WHERE THIS FILE DEPARTS FROM [M14].  [M14] states Lemma 3.2 for
      every necklace, but lambda cannot be simultaneously equivariant and
      simplotopal when some type has no bead at all: d_i is then 0 on every
      face, which forces lambda_i to be constant on K, while equivariance
      forbids a constant.  The core theorem is therefore proved under the
      hypothesis that every type occurs (c_onto), and necklace_prime recovers
      the general statement by relabelling the types that do occur
      (enum_rank_in / enum_val on the set of occurring types); this only
      decreases t, so the bound t(p-1) is preserved. *)
