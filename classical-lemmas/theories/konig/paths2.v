(** * ClassicalLemmas.konig.paths2 — the union of two matchings in a bipartite graph

    Two matchings [A] and [B] of a graph [G] with bipartition [f] meet every
    vertex at most once each, so the "share a vertex" relation on the symmetric
    difference [SS = (A \ B) u (B \ A)] has degree at most two.  Using the
    bipartition one can *orient* that relation: [nxt e] is the edge of the other
    matching that meets [e] at its [f]-true endpoint when [e in A \ B], at its
    [f]-false endpoint when [e in B \ A] ([set0] when there is none).  Then

      - [nxt] is injective where it is defined ([nxt_inj]), and
      - two distinct meeting edges are always related by [nxt] ([meetP]).

    So the components of the union are the chains of the partial injection
    [nxt]: paths and (even) cycles.  Two clients use this:

      - [konig.line_colouring] merges two matchings into one saturating all the
        max-degree vertices, by selecting along each chain the edges lying on
        the same side as the chain's last edge;
      - [Packing.foundations.fair_matching] linearises [SS] into a necklace, as the orbits of
        a permutation [sigma] extending [nxt]. *)

    HOW THIS FILE WAS OBTAINED.  It was written with Claude Code (Anthropic),
    model Claude Opus 5, on 15-16 September 2026, as one piece of the
    formalization of Conjecture 1.15 of arXiv:1611.03196 (the X15 milestone of
    packing-theory).  Rocq was driven interactively.  The rocq-mcp-evolve MCP
    server of the LLM4Rocq project,
    https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/rocq-mcp-evolve (Apache-2.0; the opam package
    still carries its former slug LLM4Rocq/rocq-tools), is used throughout this
    repository for that purpose and is gratefully acknowledged; for this file
    its cached project configuration predated the move of classical-lemmas into
    subdirectories, so goals were read instead from a small [rocq repl] harness
    and files recompiled with [rocq c].  Every error that recurred, together
    with the tactic that fixed it, is recorded in tactics-playbook.md at the
    root of the repository.  Nothing is admitted: [Print Assumptions] on the
    results of this file answers "Closed under the global context".

    ESTIMATED TOKEN COST FOR THIS FILE.  Claude Opus 5, 134k tokens, of which
    55k output.  Method: as in necklace/necklace.v — for every assistant
    message of the Claude Code session of 15-16 September 2026, input +
    cache-creation + output tokens (the tokens processed anew, excluding the
    cached conversation that is re-read at each turn), charged to the file the
    message's tool calls were acting on.  The whole X15 phase of that session
    totals 1.86M such tokens, 0.82M of them output, plus one context rebuild
    charged to no file.

             arXiv:1611.03196.  Conjecture 1.15 is the target of this
             development; it is stated in
             packing-theory/theories/conjectures/X15.v.

      [LLM]  The proof sketch attacked here,
             https://github.com/graph-theory-AI/Graph-Theory-LLM-Proofs/blob/main/attacks/1611.03196__03/output.md
             (five steps: line colouring, Carathéodory, interpolation of two
             matchings, iterated interpolation, trimming), referenced from the
             comment on [bipartite_matching_underrepresentation_llm_statement]
             in X15.v.

      No literature source: this file is infrastructure.  The fact that the
      union of two matchings is a disjoint union of paths and even cycles is
      folklore (it underlies both König's theorem and Berge's augmenting-path
      theorem); nothing comparable was available in coq-graph-theory or in this
      repository, and the orientation by the bipartition, which turns it into a
      partial injection, is what makes it usable in Rocq without any path
      combinatorics.

(** ** Linearising the union of the two matchings

    [nxt] is a partial injection of [SS]; extending it by an arbitrary
    bijection from the chain ends to the chain starts gives a permutation
    [sigma] of the whole type, which fixes everything outside [SS].  The
    orbits of [sigma] then cut [SS] into blocks, each of which is a cyclic
    [sigma]-chain; every adjacency of [SS] is an [nxt]-step, hence a step
    inside one block. *)
