    'K_2 carries an edge yet has NO genuine (length ≥ 3) cycle, so it has

(** ** Erdős–Faber–Lovász (Row 5, U1) — SETTLED-CASE truth-value forcing.

    The full statement [erdos_faber_lovasz_statement] asserts
    [edge_disjoint_clique_union G k -> χ([set: G]) = k].  The nontrivial
    UPPER bound [χ([set: G]) <= k] for all [k] is exactly the Kang–Kelly–
    Kühn–Methuku–Osthus (2023) theorem — a major result, OUT OF SCOPE and
    NOT attempted here.  We ground the right-polarity fragments that follow
    from the primitive by pure colouring theory: the always-true lower bound
    for every [k], and full equality in the two settled small cases [k=0,1].

    Reused coq-graph-theory colouring API (core/coloring.v):
      [sub_chi : A ⊆ B -> χ(A) <= χ(B)], [chi_clique : clique C -> χ(C) = #|C|],
      [leq_chi : χ(A) <= #|A|]. *)

(** (A) Always-true LOWER bound, ALL [k]: an edge-disjoint clique union with
    parameter [k] contains (for [k>0]) the [k]-vertex clique [cliqs ord0],
    whose chromatic number is [k]; monotonicity of [χ] under [⊆] lifts this to
    the whole graph.  For [k=0] the bound [0 <= χ] is trivial. *)
Lemma efl_lower_bound (G : sgraph) (k : nat) :
  edge_disjoint_clique_union G k -> (k <= χ([set: G]))%N.
Proof.

rewrite chi_clique; first by rewrite H0.
exact: Hc0.
Qed.

(** (B) Settled case [k=0]: the cover clause quantifies over [i : 'I_0], which
    is empty, so no vertex can be covered — hence [G] has no vertices,
    [#|[set: G]| = 0], and [χ = 0]. *)
Lemma efl_k0 (G : sgraph) :
  edge_disjoint_clique_union G 0 -> χ([set: G]) = 0.
Proof.
case=> cliqs [_ _ _ Hcov _].

Qed.

(** (C) Settled case [k=1]: [cliqs ord0] is a 1-vertex clique, and the cover
    clause (with the only index [ord0 : 'I_1]) forces every vertex into it, so
    [[set: G] = cliqs ord0] is a clique of size 1 and [χ = 1]. *)
Lemma efl_k1 (G : sgraph) :
  edge_disjoint_clique_union G 1 -> χ([set: G]) = 1.
Proof.
case=> cliqs [Hcard Hclq _ Hcov _].
have H0 : #|cliqs ord0| = 1 by apply: Hcard.
have Hc0 : clique (cliqs ord0) by apply: Hclq.

rewrite Heq chi_clique; first by rewrite H0.

Qed.

(** (D) k=2 — SKIPPED (reported as a blocker below).  Full equality
    [χ = 2] here needs the UPPER bound [χ([set: G]) <= 2], i.e. an explicit
    2-colouring / bipartition of the union of two ≤1-vertex-sharing edges.  No
    coq-graph-theory lemma yields [χ <= 2] without constructing that colouring
    (a genuine case split on whether the two K_2's share a vertex), so this is
    left unproven rather than weakened. *)

(** ** Erdős–Lovász double-critical (Row 1, U1) — right-polarity fragments.

    The full [double_critical_graph_statement] (every connected double-critical
    [n]-chromatic graph is [K_n]) is the Erdős–Lovász conjecture; its
    load-bearing settled cases [k=4,5] are the Mozhan (1983) / Stiebitz (1987)
    structural theorems, OUT OF SCOPE and NOT attempted.  We ground the
    fragments that force the correct truth value without those theorems: the
    whole conjectured-extremal family [K_n] genuinely satisfies every hypothesis
    of the statement (teeth), and the elementary [n=1] slice of the FULL
    statement is proved TRUE.

    Reused API: [chi_clique], [sub_clique], [subsetDl], [cardsD], [clique_bound],

    and the local [clique_complete]/[chi_complete]/[Delta_complete]. *)

(** (A) TEETH — the whole extremal family [K_{n+2}] is double-critical:
    deleting any adjacent pair leaves a [K_n], dropping [χ] by exactly [2].
    Strictly generalises the existing [double_critical_K2] witness (its [n=0]
    case), so the [double_critical] hypothesis is non-vacuous on every [K_n]
    with [n ≥ 2] — the conjecture targets the correct graph class. *)

(** (B) TEETH — every complete graph [K_{n+1}] is connected, so the

(** (C) TEETH — the extremal family [K_{n+2}] jointly satisfies ALL premises of
    the statement AND its conclusion ([K ≃ K] via [diso_id]); so each [K_n]
    ([n ≥ 2]) is a genuine fixed point of the conjecture's implication, and the
    premise/conclusion set is inhabited for every chromatic number [≥ 2]. *)

(** (D) SMALL-INSTANCE — the FULL statement at [n=1], proved TRUE: a connected
    double-critical graph with [χ = 1] is [K_1].  [χ = 1] forces edgelessness
    (an edge is a 2-clique, so [ω ≥ 2 ≤ χ], contradiction); connectivity plus
    edgelessness plus non-emptiness force [#|G| = 1] (by [connected_card_gt1]);
    the single-vertex graph is then explicitly [≃ 'K_1].  A genuine settled
    slice of the conjecture, not a vacuous one. *)

    The full [cycles_in_graphs_of_large_chromatic_number_statement]
    ([2 < k] and [k < χ] ⟹ [(k+1)(k-1)! ≤ 2·count_cycles_mod G k]) is the
    Erdős/Gyárfás cycle-counting conjecture; every settled sub-case is itself a

(** (A) BOUNDARY — [count_cycles_mod 'K_2 1 = 0]: the genuine-cycle filter
    [2 < L] is empty over the tiny index range [L < #|'K_2|.+1 = 3], so the

(** (A) ALWAYS-TRUE DIRECTION — the [ω ≤ χ] half of the conjectured equality
