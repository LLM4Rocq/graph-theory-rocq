(** * Digraph.oriented — oriented digraphs (no loops, no antiparallel pairs)

    The [Oriented] structure sits between [DiGraph] and [Tournament]
    (CK3 plan, Decision D9): an oriented digraph is a finite digraph whose
    arc relation is irreflexive and asymmetric. Tournaments acquire the
    structure through the [DiGraph_IsTournament] factory in
    core/tournament.v, so every existing tournament instance is an oriented
    digraph silently.

    Theory (dossier items O1, O2 — stated for arbitrary vertex subsets and
    arbitrary k, per Decision D12):
    - out-degrees at the digraph level ([outdeg], [outdeg_in]) — defined for
      ANY finite digraph;
    - O1: twice the arc count of D[A] is at most |A|(|A|−1)
      ([oriented_arcs_bound]); some vertex of a nonempty A has inner
      out-degree ≤ (|A|−1)./2 ([oriented_avg_bound]); |A| ≥ 2k+1 when all
      inner out-degrees are ≥ k ([oriented_mindeg_card], [oriented_card]);
    - O2: the alias [outsel f] keeps only the arcs selected by [f];
      [outsel] of an oriented digraph is oriented, and so is every subtype
      of an oriented digraph; with [f := ksel k], every out-degree becomes
      exactly k whenever k ≤ δ⁺(D) ([outsel_ksel_outdeg]). *)
