(** * Digraph.ck3_main — Conjecture 1 at δ = 3: every oriented graph with
      minimum out-degree 3 has a directed path of length 6

    The δ = 3 endgame (dossier §3, E0–E5) on top of the Lemma 7 kernel,
    and the main theorem (dossier MAIN = the k3 hand proof's headline):

    - [no_short_strong3]: no strong 3-outregular oriented digraph has
      ℓ ≤ 5 — E0 kills ℓ ≤ 4 by the average bound; at ℓ = 5 the kernel
      forces |S| = 3 with all inner out-degrees 1 and a = 1 (E1), v₅ ∈ S
      (E2), the full fan-out of S onto C∖S (E3), σ-closure of S under the
      cycle predecessor (E4), and walking the closure four steps from v₅
      swallows all five cycle vertices (E5) — contradiction;
    - [ck_conj1_delta3]: δ⁺(D) ≥ 3 ⟹ ℓ(D) ≥ 6 (with 0 < #|D|: the empty
      digraph vacuously satisfies the hypothesis but has no path —
      dossier landmine 3);
    - [ck_conj1_delta3_path]: the unfolded exists-a-path form (D11). *)
