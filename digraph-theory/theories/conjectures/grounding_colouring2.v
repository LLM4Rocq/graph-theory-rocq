(** * Digraph.conjectures.grounding_colouring2 — STATEMENT-LEVEL grounding for
    colouring_variants.v (pass 2: the parts NOT covered by grounding_chi_col.v).

    grounding_chi_col.v already grounded the oriented-colouring and the
    [majority_col] / [c3const] red-flag side of colouring_variants.v.  This file
    grounds the REMAINING machinery — the arc-colouring / monochromatic
    reachability and the parametric majority bound — along the three
    faithfulness axes:

      (1) NON-VACUITY: each of the four open _statement Props ranges over a
          hypothesis class; we exhibit a CONCRETE inhabitant of every antecedent
          (majority_3col_statement: a digraph; oriented_chromatic_planar_bounded:
          a loopless planar oriented digraph; mono_reach_or_rainbow:
          a nonempty 3-arc-coloured tournament; sands_sauer_woodrow:
          a k-arc-coloured digraph).  A forall over an empty class says nothing.

      (2) SMALL-INSTANCE WITNESSES / VALUES on tiny digraphs:
          - a CONCRETE majority 3-colouring of C3 (the constant colouring FAILS,
            but an honest rainbow colouring SUCCEEDS — value-level check that the
            existential head of Conj 2 holds on the directed triangle);
          - a CONCRETE [kmajority_col] witness for k=2,3 on TT 2 (single arc);
          - a CONCRETE [mono_reach] instance on a 1-arc-coloured TT 2 (0 reaches
            1 in the unique colour, and reflexively everywhere);
          - a CONCRETE [rainbow_triangle] on C3 (the identity-on-arcs colouring
            assigns the three cyclic arcs three distinct colours);
          - a CONCRETE [mono_root] on C3 (constant arc-colouring: vertex 0 reaches
            every vertex via the monochromatic directed cycle).

      (3) TRIVIALITY / FALSIFICATION probes: an OPEN conjecture must be NEITHER
          provable nor refutable / not vacuous / not trivially true.  We pin:
          - [mono_root] is NOT automatic: the EMPTY arc-colouring of TT 2 (so no
            arc carries any colour) has NO monochromatic root, because vertex 0
            cannot reach 1.  So the disjunction in [mono_reach_or_rainbow] has
            real content (it is not "rainbow ∨ trivially-true");
          - [rainbow_triangle] is NOT automatic: a CONSTANT 3-arc-colouring of C3
            has NO rainbow triangle (its three arcs share a colour).  So the
            "rainbow" disjunct is also not free;
          - [majority_col] is NOT vacuously satisfied by every colouring (the
            constant colouring of C3 fails — re-confirmed here via the parametric
            [kmajority_col] at k=2).

    for every k; for any k ≥ 1 the class is inhabited (C3 with a constant
    k-colouring).  For k = 0 the colour type 'I_0 is empty, so there is NO
    arc-colouring of a digraph WITH an arc — a genuine (and correct) degeneracy
    we record, since SSW is only interesting for k ≥ 1. *)

    arc) is loopless and oriented; its underlying graph is a single edge, which
    is planar.  We record the loopless witness here (planarity of a single edge
    is supplied by two_extremal.planar_sg's K5/K33-minor-free criterion, which a
    2-vertex graph trivially meets — established at the two_extremal level). *)

    Here we exhibit a colouring that SUCCEEDS: colour each vertex with its own
    'Z_3 index (the "rainbow" / identity colouring).  Then every vertex's unique
    out-neighbour [v+1] has a DIFFERENT colour, so the same-colour
    out-neighbourhood is empty and 2·0 ≤ outdeg trivially. *)

(** ** H. RIGHT-POLARITY fragments of [mono_reach_or_rainbow_statement].

    The open statement is: every nonempty 3-arc-coloured tournament has a
    rainbow triangle OR a monochromatic-reachability root.  The grounding above
    (sections A/D/E/F) only inhabits the class and exercises the two disjuncts
    in isolation on a fixed colouring.  Here we PIN THE STATEMENT TRUE, via its
    RIGHT disjunct [exists v, mono_root c v], on the settled dominating-vertex
    sub-cases — for ARBITRARY 3-arc-colourings — and we confirm the [0 < #|T|]
    guard is load-bearing (not vacuizing).  These are genuine truth-value
    forcing facts: they discharge the conjecture on an infinite sub-family and
    the smallest nonempty parameter without touching the open general case. *)

(** *** H.1  ALWAYS-TRUE-DIRECTION.  In ANY tournament, a source vertex [v]
    (one that dominates every other vertex) is a monochromatic-reachability
    root for EVERY 3-arc-colouring: it reaches itself by the empty colour-[ord0]
    path, and every other [w] by the single arc [v --> w] taken in its own
    colour [c v w].  So the RIGHT disjunct of the statement holds outright, and
    it holds uniformly over all colourings — the colouring is never consulted to
    decide reachability past the first arc.  This is the reusable core: the
    whole tournaments-with-a-source class satisfies the statement. *)

    dominates all others (in [TT n], [0 --> w] iff [0 < val w], which holds for

    H.1.  This is the smallest nonempty parameter of the statement, decided TRUE
