(** * Digraph.conjectures.grounding_sad2 — DEEPER GROUNDING of [sad.v]

    Companion to [grounding_sad_packing.v].  Beyond the directed-cycle λ = 1
    facts, this file exercises the heavy machinery of [sad.v]: [spanning_strong],
    [SAD], [SAD_colouring], and the non-vacuity / triviality calibration of the
    three Prop-nodes [bang_jensen_yeo_SAD_statement], [WC3_statement],
    [CL1_statement].  Every lemma is [Qed]; the file imports ONLY committed
    modules.

    Grounded facts (each tied to a textbook statement):

      1. A CONCRETE Strong Arc Decomposition.  The bidirected directed cycle
         [Bicyc n] (each vertex [i] has arcs to BOTH neighbours [i±1]) for
         [n ≥ 3] has a SAD: its arc set is the disjoint union of the FORWARD
         directed Hamilton cycle [i → i+1] and the BACKWARD directed Hamilton
         cycle [i → i-1], each spanning and strongly connected.  This is the
         smallest nontrivial SAD example (a 2-arc-strong digraph that DOES
         decompose; cf. Bang-Jensen–Yeo, two arc-disjoint spanning strong
         subdigraphs).  We exhibit it via [SAD_colouring] (an arc is coloured by
         "is it a forward arc?") and bridge to [SAD].

      2. [spanning_strong] of a CONCRETE arc set: the forward Hamilton cycle on
         [Bicyc n] is spanning-strong (every ordered pair is joined by a directed
         path of forward arcs — iterate the successor); likewise the backward.

      3. [arc_strong] of a concrete digraph at k = 2: [Bicyc n] (n ≥ 3) is
         2-arc-strong — every nonempty proper out-cut has ≥ 2 arcs (a forward and
         a backward boundary arc).  Grounds [arc_strong] at a value > 1 (the
         cycle only gave 1) and supplies the NON-VACUITY witness for the
         hypothesis class of the three conjecture nodes.

    NON-VACUITY of the statement nodes:
      - [bang_jensen_yeo_SAD_statement] / [WC3_statement] hypothesis class
        "[0 < #|D|] ∧ arc_strong D k" is INHABITED (witness [Bicyc 3], k ≤ 2) AND
        the conclusion [SAD] is achievable there — so neither node is vacuously
        true nor obviously false on its witness.
      - [CL1_statement] hypothesis class is inhabited ([CL1_premises_inhabited]): a vertex
        split [V = V1 ⊎ V2] with both sides ≥ 2, each induced side admitting a SAD, and each
        bridge out-cut split into two nonempty colour parts.  The witness is the 6-vertex host
        [H6] (two bidirected triangles + a two-way bridge), NOT [Bicyc 4]: a SAD-admitting
        side must be ≥ 3 vertices (no 2-vertex digraph has a SAD), so each side is a
        bidirected triangle (SAD via the generic [SAD_complete3]).

    TRIVIALITY / FALSIFICATION probes (reported, all benign here):
      - [SAD] is NOT trivially-true: a digraph that is not strongly connected has
        no SAD.  We show [~ SAD] for the 2-vertex single-arc digraph.
      - [arc_strong] is satisfiable NON-trivially at k = 2 ([Bicyc] reaches 2),
        so "K-arc-strong" is a genuine sliding threshold.
      - [spanning_strong] is NOT trivially true: the empty arc set is not
        spanning-strong on any digraph with ≥ 2 vertices. *)

(** ** GROUNDING 4 — CL1 non-vacuity: the hypothesis class of [CL1_statement] is INHABITED.

    [CL1_statement] is a bilateral SAD-from-SAD lifting: from a vertex split [V = V1 ⊎ V2]
    (each side ≥ 2, each induced side admitting a SAD, each bridge out-cut split into two
    nonempty colour parts) it concludes [SAD D].  Establishing that this premise class is
    not vacuous is subtle: a side admitting a SAD must ITSELF be a 2-arc-strong digraph,
    and the SMALLEST digraph with a SAD is the bidirected TRIANGLE (a 2-vertex side, e.g.
    a digon or a slice of [Bicyc 4], can never have a SAD — a spanning-strong subdigraph on
    2 vertices needs both arcs, leaving none for the second class).  So the honest witness
    is a 6-vertex host [H6] = two bidirected triangles [{0,1,2}] and [{3,4,5}] joined by a
    two-way bridge ([0↔3], [1↔4]).  Then [V1 = {0,1,2}], [V2 = {3,4,5}] each induce a
    bidirected triangle (hence a SAD, via the generic [SAD_complete3] below), each side has
    ≥ 2 vertices, and each bridge out-cut ([δ⁺(V1) = {0→3, 1→4}], [δ⁺(V2) = {3→0, 4→1}])
    has two arcs, so it splits into two nonempty colour parts.  Hence every premise of CL1
    is simultaneously satisfiable: [CL1_statement] is neither vacuously true nor obviously
    false on its witness. *)

(** A complete-symmetric 3-vertex digraph (arcs = [≠], i.e. the bidirected triangle) has a
    Strong Arc Decomposition: its 6 arcs split into the two oriented Hamilton 3-cycles

(** NOTE — the SAD cluster of [sad.v] is now fully grounded.  The centerpiece [SAD_Bicyc]

    its colouring form [SAD_colouring_Bicyc], its 2-arc-strength [bicyc_arc_strong], the
    discriminating probe [TT2_not_SAD], and the CL1 non-vacuity witness
    [CL1_premises_inhabited] (the previously-open [CL1_bridge_*] trailer, here closed via
    the generic [SAD_complete3] and the 6-vertex two-triangle host [H6]) are all PROVED,

(** ** Technique-#3 faithfulness cross-check for [strongb] (from [strong.v]).

    We give an INDEPENDENT second encoding of strong connectivity — the global
    min-cut characterization [arc_strong D 1] of [sad.v] ("every nonempty proper
    vertex set has a non-empty out-cut") — and prove it equivalent to the
    reachability encoding [strongb D = forall x y, connect arc x y].

    The two are genuinely different mathematics: [strongb] is a transitive-closure
    reachability statement (fingraph [connect]); [arc_strong 1] is a universal
    counting/min-cut condition over the 2^|D| vertex subsets (a Robbins/Menger-
    flavoured global characterization). The proof is NOT definitional — the forward
    direction extracts a crossing arc from a reachability path via [connect_cross],
    and the backward direction runs the sink/reachable-set argument ([rset_closed],
    [rset_id]) showing a closed reachable set has an empty out-cut, so [arc_strong 1]
    forces it to be everything. A direction bug (arc orientation, one-way vs two-way
    reachability, or an off-by-one in the cut) breaks the [<->]. *)
