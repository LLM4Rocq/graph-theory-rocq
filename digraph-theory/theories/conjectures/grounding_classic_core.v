(** * Digraph.conjectures.grounding_classic_core — faithfulness grounding for classic_core

    GROUNDING (not new mathematics): prove small, KNOWN textbook facts that the new
    primitives in [classic_core.v] (Nout / Nin / indeg / Nout2 / diregular) and the
    open-conjecture statements (Seymour, Caccetta–Häggkvist) must satisfy if the
    definitions are faithful encodings.

    Facts grounded here:
      - [tournament_indeg_outdeg]  : in a tournament, indeg v + outdeg v = #|T| - 1
                                     (the textbook tournament degree identity: every other
                                      vertex is exactly one of an in- or out-neighbour).
      - [Nout_is_outdeg]           : outdeg v = #|Nout v| (Nout matches the lib outdeg).
      - [C3_diregular1]            : the directed triangle is 1-diregular.
      - [TT_has_source]/[TT_has_sink] : TT n.+1 has a vertex of out-degree n (source) and
                                     a vertex of in-degree n (sink).
      - [Nout2_disjoint_self]/[Nout2_disjoint_Nout] : Nout2 v avoids v and Nout v
                                     (sanity of the second-out-neighbourhood definition).
      - [C3_has_seymour_vertex]    : C3 has a vertex v with outdeg v <= #|Nout2 v|
                                     (the SNC conclusion is SATISFIABLE; Fisher proved SNC
                                      for tournaments).
      - red-flag falsification probes for the open statements (see the comments and
                                     [seymour_nonvacuous] / [ch_triangle_nonvacuous]). *)

(** ** [Nout2] sanity: it avoids [v] and [Nout v].

    Grounds: the second out-neighbourhood is, by construction, the set of vertices at
    directed distance EXACTLY two — disjoint from [v] itself and from the (distance-one)
    out-neighbours. A definition where these overlapped would be wrong. *)

(** ** A Seymour vertex in C3 (SNC conclusion is satisfiable).

    Grounds: Seymour's Second Neighbourhood Conjecture asserts some vertex [v] has
    outdeg v <= #|Nout2 v|. We exhibit such a [v] concretely in C3, confirming the
    conclusion is achievable (Fisher's theorem proves SNC for all tournaments).
    In C3, outdeg = 1 and the unique distance-2 vertex is u-1, so #|Nout2 u| = 1. *)

(** ** RED-FLAG falsification probes.

    An OPEN conjecture statement must be NEITHER provably true NOR provably false, and
    must not be vacuous. We check the hypotheses of the Seymour / CH-triangle statements
    are satisfiable (non-vacuous) by exhibiting a concrete instance that meets them, so the
    [forall D, hyp -> concl] statement actually quantifies over a nonempty class. *)

(** C3 satisfies the (nonempty) hypothesis of Seymour's statement: this shows the universal
    statement is not vacuous (there exist oriented graphs with 0 < #|D|). *)
Lemma seymour_nonvacuous : (0 < #|{: C3}|)%N.
Proof. by rewrite card_C3. Qed.

(** C3 is a witness that the CH-triangle hypotheses are SATISFIABLE: #|C3| = 3, each vertex
    has out-degree 1, and 3 <= 3 * 1. So the antecedent [forall v, #|D| <= 3*outdeg v] is
    met by a genuine instance — the statement is not vacuous. And indeed C3 DOES contain a
    directed triangle, consistent with (but not proving) the conjecture. *)
Lemma ch_triangle_hyp_C3 : (forall v : C3, (#|{: C3}| <= 3 * outdeg v)%N).
Proof. by move=> v; rewrite card_C3 C3_outdeg. Qed.

(** C3 satisfies the CH-statement hypotheses: looplessness, positive order, r=1 min
    out-degree. Non-vacuity witness for [caccetta_haggkvist_statement]. *)
Lemma ch_hyp_C3 :
  (0 < #|{: C3}|)%N /\ (forall v : C3, ~~ ((v : C3) --> v)) /\
  (0 < 1)%N /\ (forall v : C3, (1 <= outdeg v)%N).
